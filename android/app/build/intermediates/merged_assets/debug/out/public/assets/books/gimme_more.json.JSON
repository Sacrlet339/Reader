I see you
And I just want to dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just want to go that extra mile for you
Your public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (we keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin' (keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (they keep watching)
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
A center of attention (do you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You've got me in a crazy position (yeah)
If you're on a mission (uh-uh)
You got my permission (oh)
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin', rockin' (oh)
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (they keep watching)
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd are saying
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more)

Well, I'll give them more
Ow! (More)
